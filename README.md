<h2>Introduction.</h2>

Hello I'm known as neos,

I am a beginner scripter, I'm interested in Python and Lua(specifically LuaU). I'm interested in cyber-security, specifically web-application hacking, malware-development and networking. My favourite python library is 'requests' as it makes sending HTTP requests very simple, I can explore APIs easily with 'requests'.

My target languages to learn soon: C++, Javascript
